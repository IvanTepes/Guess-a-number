# Guess a Number

![Guess a Number](assets/readme_files/img/mockup/mockup_all_devices.png)
Guess the number is a game in which the user tries to guess a number between one and twenty.
I wrote this game to practice bootstrap, css, scss and javascript.
I have included six themes in the game that are completely unnecessary, but they served me for scss practice.

## Demo

You can access the game [here.](https://ivantepes.github.io/Guess-a-number/)
